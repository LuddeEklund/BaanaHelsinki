# BaanaHelsinki

Bicycling in Helsinki

This project is inspired by a tradition of analysing the flow of bicycles at some checkpoint. I have chosen "Baana", a pretty new bicycle road from central Helsinki to Ruoholahti. Baana is built on an old railroad track and is separated from the city traffic. This code is based on the AirQualitySensor code. Bicycle data is nice in that way, that it is easy to analyse and draw conclusions. And as we know, the demand for results and beautiful packages are big.
